# Computational coffee 15/3/2021; bring your software problems

We started the session by briefly discussing our use of Numba. While several of us had ongoing projects where we 
were planning to make use of Numba nobody had done so thus far. We then moved onto several 'software problems'.

First, we looked at how to reuse functions in different python programs or Jupyter notebooks. This can be done
by putting the functions in a python module (a file containing the functions called `module_name.py`) and the
functions accessed by including `import module_name` and the calling `module_name.function_name()`. In this
way python provides a namespace (to avoid function name collisons) and a way to store, group and reuse functions
(or other variables). Further documentation lives at https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html.

This led to a discussion of when we use python via Jupyter notebooks and when we use python via scripts that run
from the command line (or from an IDE like spyder). Our practice varies but we often use Jupyter at the start of
prjects (as an easy way to work out how to solve a problem / get some proof of concept working) or at the end
(to do analysis / figure making) moving the middle bit to scripts. This led to a discussion of the interaction
between Git (for version control) and Jupyter notebooks, and the use of debuggers for python.
We migrated back to 'problems' to look at an NumPy warning about ragged arrays. This was related to 
[NumPy enhancment proposal 34](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0034-infer-dtype-is-object.html).

There were two problems we did not get around to. One on the different ways to access Fortran from Python, 
and one on the best machine (HPC or desktop) to train ML models. We decided that our next meeting would
focus on the use of git for version control.
