# CompEarthSci

A repository for computational Earth science at Oxford. 

This repository is a convent means of sharing material for meetings and discussions between 
researchers in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Oxford whose research 
involves computational science. Software found in this repository is generally designed for
illustration rather than use but in time we may host a collection of links to research software
developed in the Department. Some of our activities are listed below.

## Computational coffee

From March 2021 we started meeting virtually every couple of weeks to share experience and
expertise, and to discuss various aspects of computational Earth sciences. The meeting
schedule (with links to material) is below.
