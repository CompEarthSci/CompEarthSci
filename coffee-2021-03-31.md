# Computational coffee 31/3/2021; git for version control

This week we will try to make sure everybody is comfortable using git and github. We will
assume some familiarity with git from the command line (the `git init`, `git add`, `git mv`,
`git rm`, `git commit`, `git log` and `git status` commands) but will start of with a recap
of this creating a repository on github. We will then try an exercise where we work in pairs
or groups of three to deliberatly create and resolve merge conflicts before discussing the
various stratergies for working together with git. Finally, we will outline the various 
other tasks that can be undertaken using git and github (which may prompt plans for future
sessions).

Those who have not used git before should spend a bit of time ahead of the meeting becoming
familiar with the basic commands. 

## Uses of git / github / other hosting services

Any of these could be the subject of future meetings.

*  Branching (and merging) in git
* 'Forking' repositories and other ways of working with multiple people
*  Code review, pull requests.
*  Issue trackers
*  Running things (e.g. tests) when making commits
*  Hosting web pages
*  Releases, creating DOIs. How this can meet publisher requierments.
*  Rebasing
*  Using online repositories to spin up services (e.g. virtual machines, binder instances etc.)
*  Choosing between command line, gui, web clients, and solutions integrated into IDEs.
