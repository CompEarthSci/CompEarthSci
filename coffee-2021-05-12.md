# Computational coffee 12/5/2021; research data - options and ideas

After a few weeks of use of the new University Advanced Research Computing cluster
we'll meet to share tips, tricks, and help each other get the best out of the system.

Draft agenda:

* Available compute resources - where ARC fits in
* A brief overview of the ARC hardware
* The Earth Science co-investment
* Getting access and logging on
* SLURM and running jobs
* Building software
* Q&A / AOB / other things

Let Andrew know if there is anything else you want to discuss, or add notes to
[this issue](https://github.com/andreww/CompEarthSci/issues/3)
