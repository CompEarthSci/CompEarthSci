# ARC for Earth Science users

Some (hopefully helpful) information for ARC users in Earth Sciences can be found
below along with some example scripts. New users (to ARC, or to high perfomance
computing in general) may benifit from a discussing plans with Andrew Walker
(andrew.walker@earth.ox.ac.uk).

## Links and quick start

Documentation - links etc.

## Compiling on the new ARC cluster

The login and submission nodes on the new arc cluster (arc-login.arc.ox.ac.uk)
have different processors to the compute nodes. Compile in an interactive
session.
