# Computational coffee 3/3/2021; introductions and Numba

In order for these meetings to be sucessful, we'll need to become comfortable
sharing ideas, feedback and even code with each other. We need to develop a
welcoming and supportive environment and foster a positive and professional
learning environment. To do this we will avoid any form of behaviour that
excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort. Instead we will use welcoming
and inclusive language, be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences,
gracefully accept constructive criticism and show courtesy and respect towards
each other.

In order to help foster a supportive environemnt we will spend the first part of
our first meeting introducing ourselves and describing how we use computational
science in our research. We could each include information such as which area of
Earth sciences we work in, what computational facilities we make use of, and what
software we use. We only have about two minutes each for this.

In the second part of the session Andrew will describe one use of the python
Numba package. Numba is a compiler for (a subset of) python and allows numerical
code to be optimised with little effort. Files for the example can be found
here.

In the final part of this week's meeting we will discuss our future plans. Next week
we will have a "bring your software problems" session and we'll need two or three
volenteers for this. For planning it is probably useful to know that almost everybody
is happy using Python or Matlab but that there is no single language that *everybody*
is comfortable using. About half of us have experiance of Fortran or C. Some ideas with
strong support from the questionnaire were "using github to collaborate", "releasing
software", "licences" and "dealing with data".
