# Computational coffee 14/4/2021; research data - options and ideas

I want to start this week by reviewing what we've looked at over the last few sessions.
Have you started to use git? Are there particular "advanced" use cases of git that we
should look at in future sessions? (I've created a list of these
at the end of the relevent meeting notes [here](
https://github.com/andreww/CompEarthSci/blob/main/coffee-2021-03-31.md)). Has anybody had sucersses 
or difficulties using Numba?
Are there any updates from the 'bring you software problems' session?

My plan is to then spend some time discussing how we use and store research data
in the department. As well as discussing what we do now, I'll have some updates 
about potential University and Departmental plans. In order to help get us started
I've listed some of the available resources below. Who uses what?

## Some resources at Oxford

Roughly going from 'live data' towards data repositories:

1. Departmental storage. Purchased by (and alocated to) research groups. Physically
hosted in the Department. 
2. Storage on [ARC clusters](https://www.arc.ox.ac.uk/). 15 GB per user homespace, 5 TB per project data storage, plus 
non-persistent scratch (multi-node) and temp (per node). To support computation on the ARC
clusters.
3. Space on [ARCHER2](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/) and [JASMIN](https://www.jasmin.ac.uk/) if you have accounts/access
to these machines.
5. Possibility of Oxford based "research file store" in future.
6. [Research data Oxford](https://researchdata.ox.ac.uk/) has various [useful links](
https://researchdata.ox.ac.uk/home/tools-services-and-training/) including to the
[Oxford Research Archive](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/) and [IT services backup system](https://help.it.ox.ac.uk/hfs#/).
7. The [Sustainable Digital Scholarship service](https://www.sds.ox.ac.uk/) in the Humanities division hosts
a local [Oxford Figshare](https://figshare.sds.ox.ac.uk/) portal.
8. Services like [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/), [Figshare](https://figshare.com/) and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)
can be used for archiving data.
9. You may be requiered to archive data at one of the [five NERC environmental data centers](
https://nerc.ukri.org/research/sites/environmental-data-service-eds/)
10. You may use a subject specific repository, such as the [IRIS data service](http://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/data/)
for seismology.
